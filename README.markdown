Gyro OSC Processing Bridge
------------------

Simple osc bridge between processing and [gyrosc](http://www.bitshapesoftware.com/instruments/gyrosc/).

To understand the difference between an accelerometer and a gyroscope reference [this link](http://www.livescience.com/40103-accelerometer-vs-gyroscope.html).

Set your IP address in the gyrosc app to the IP address of the network you are on. You can find this information by looking at system preference > network. 

If this doesn't work because of restrictions on the school network try creating your own network on your computer and then adding your phone to that network.
